# Banking_CaseStudy
 
I started with a raw banking dataset and set out to understand how customers actually use financial products. Through exploratory analysis, I noticed some clear behavioral patterns—like how people who maintain savings accounts almost always use checking and deposit accounts too.

I explored correlations between features, which helped me identify natural clusters: one around day-to-day transactions, and another focused on credit usage and lending. To go a step further, I used PCA to reduce the complexity and visualize these groupings. It was fascinating to see how tightly some features clustered, and how others—like income and retirement savings—stood apart, almost as if they belonged to an entirely different layer of customer behavior.

More than just charts and numbers, this analysis helped me tell a story about customer habits, risk tendencies, and financial priorities.
